```{r}
#3. Load the libraries  `tidyr` and `dplyr`.
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")

#4. Create a data frame from the `swirl-data.csv` file called `DF1`.
DF1 <- read.csv("swirl-data.csv", header = TRUE)

#5. Create a new data frame that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `attempt` called `DF2`.
DF2 <- select(DF1,hash,lesson_name,attempt)

#6. Use the `group_by` function to create a data frame that sums all the attempts for each `hash` by each `lesson_name` called `DF3`.
DF3 <- DF1 %>% group_by(hash,lesson_name) %>% summarise(sum(attempt))

#7. On a scrap piece of paper draw what you think `DF3` would look like if all the lesson names were column names.
#8. Convert `DF3` to this format.
name <- c("hash","lesson_name","count")
colnames (DF3) <- name
DF3 <- DF3 %>% na.omit()
#na.omit()is more effective than filter()with logic

#9. Create a new data frame from `DF1` called `DF4` that only includes the variables `hash` and `correct`. 
DF4 <- select(DF1,hash,correct)

#10. Convert the `correct` variable so that `TRUE` is coded as the **number** `1` and `FALSE` is coded as `0`.
#Since we have some missing data here, if we just delete it as missing value, we are going to lose entries. So I'm going to fill NA with 0.
DF4$correct <- recode(DF4$correct, "TRUE" = 1, "FALSE" = 0)
DF4 <- DF4 %>% mutate(correct = coalesce(correct, 0))

#11. Create a new data frame that called `DF4` that provides a mean score for each student.
DF4 <- DF4 %>%  
  group_by(hash) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(correct))

#12. **Extra credit** Convert the `datetime` variable into month-day-year format and create a new data frame (`DF5`) that shows the average correct for each day.
DF5 <- select(DF1, datetime,correct)
DF5 <- filter(DF5,!is.na(datetime))
##Convert the datetime
DF5$datetime <- structure(DF5$datetime,class=c('POSIXt','POSIXct'))
DF5$day <- format(DF5$datetime, "%m-%d-%Y")
##Recode the correct
DF5$correct <- recode(DF5$correct, "TRUE" = 1, "FALSE" = 0)
DF5 <- DF5 %>% mutate(correct = coalesce(correct, 0))
##Average correct for each day
DF5 <- DF5 %>%  
  group_by(day) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(correct))

```
